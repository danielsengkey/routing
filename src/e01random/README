This Example 01 is a simple routing example.
The used routing strategy is random forwarding.
It means the routers (nodes) will choose random gate to forward the packet.
In NodeRandom2 the node still use uniform distribution to choose the out gate,
except the incoming ones. 
This example is similar with TicToc.
No neighbour discovery in this example.
